I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey,
and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the
game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions
has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt
of, in the last few years.  

Spending almost 2 years now in web development, and a year in pentesting I have landed myself
into various opportunistic projects and platform to work with people 
with diverse intellect. For me work has always been my priority. 

### A word of advice for every beginner out there:
## Be Hungry, Be Foolish
